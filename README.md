# BombRushRadio
A Bomb Rush Cyberfunk mod that lets you add custom music into the game!

## Installation

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Kade-github/BombRushRadio/releases/latest), and download either:

### BepInEx Included

A version of the mod with BepInEx included.

To install:

**Drag'N'Drop the contents of the zip inside of your games root directory**

### Standalone

You must have BepInEx already installed,

To install:

**Put the .dll in your BepInEx/Plugins/ folder**

It should look like this at the very end

## How to use

Launch the game once, then navigate to your games root directory, go into **"Bomb Rush Cyberfunk_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods/BombRushRadio/Songs/"** which the mod should have created, then drag .mp3's in that folder.

The format is pretty simple, "**Artist-SongTitle**"

It should look like this

## Building

Create a Publicized Assembly of the game, through anything (I used BepInEx's one, oh and I can't provide this because its a paid game)

And then open the .sln, and add in most of the missing references.

Then just build it.
